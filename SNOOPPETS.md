This is another file with snippets:
<div class="snippet" sequences="first.sh,second.sh">
  
```
echo "I AM INBOTH SEQUENCES, TREMBLE BEFORE ME!"
```
  
</div>

Here's a code snippet for only the first sequence:
<div class="snippet" sequences="first.sh">
  
```
echo "I MAYBE IN ONE SEQUENCE ONLY, BUT I'M STILL PRETTY COOL"
```
  
</div>

Here's a code snippet for only the second sequence:
<div class="snippet" sequences="second.sh">
  
```
echo "I'm in the second sequence"
```
  
</div>

</div>

Here's a code snippet for the third, Windows shell sequence:
<div class="snippet" sequences="windows.bat">
  
```
ECHO "I'm the only command in the third sequence. I am kind of lonely. Also I'm Windows."
```
  
</div>
